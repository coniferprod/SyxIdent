# syxident

SyxIdent is a command-line utility for macOS that can be used to identify 
MIDI System Exclusive messages saved in disk files. The program uses the
[SyxPack](https://github.com/coniferprod/SyxPack) package. Both are written in Swift 5.

The development of the SyxPack library and the SyxIdent utility are 
described in the book [_Bytes of Swift_](https://books.apple.com/us/book/bytes-of-swift/id1603196148?itsct=books_box_link&itscg=30200&ls=1&at=1l3vbcz&ct=github) by Jere KÃ¤pyaho, published on Apple Books by Conifer Productions Oy.
